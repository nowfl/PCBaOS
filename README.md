# PCBaOS

**PCBaOS** is a custom desktop environment and app suite for Windows, built in VB.NET. Think of it as your own little “operating system” inside Windows, with a bunch of handy tools and a unique, retro-modern vibe.

## What is PCBaOS?

- A desktop environment with its own file manager, calendar, text editor, paint app, image viewer, and more—all running in a safe, sandboxed space.
- Everything happens inside a special `Kernel` folder, so you can experiment, create, and organize without touching your real system files.
- Features context menus, a stylish address bar, reminders, custom wallpapers, and lots of little quality-of-life touches.
- Open files with the right app (like “Open With” in Windows), copy/paste files and folders, and personalize your workspace.
- Built for fun, learning, and productivity—no admin rights or risky installs needed.
